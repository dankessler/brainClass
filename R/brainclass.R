#' Transcriptional data guided fMRI network classification
#'
#' The `brainclass` function performs fMRI network classification where edges
#' in each fMRI network are treated as a long vector and used as features.
#'
#' @param X A matrix with the training samples, in wich each row represents the
#' vectorized (by column order) upper triangular part of a network adjacency
#' matrix.
#' @param y A vector containing the class labels of the training samples (2
#' classes by default).
#' @param edgeGrp A list of vectors, each containing integer indices or
#' character names of variables in the group.
#' @param family See grpregOverlap::grpregOverlap for details.
#' Default is "binomial".
#' @param penalty See grpregOverlap::grpregOverlap for details.
#' Default is "grLasso".
#' @param lambda See grpregOverlap::grpregOverlap for details.
#' Default is 5e-3.
#'
#' @return An object with S3 class "grpregOverlap".
#' See grpregOverlap::`grpregOverlap` for details.
